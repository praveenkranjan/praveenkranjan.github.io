<p>I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at San Antonio, specializing in motion planning strategies for cooperative and adversarial maneuvering of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). My research is centered on developing advanced guidance laws that enable UAVs to exhibit complex behaviors such as formation flying, target enclosing, and swarming, whether collaboratively or in the presence of adversarial agents. My work emphasizes integrating flexibility, safety, and robustness into motion planning algorithms, ensuring reliable operation under limited information and communication constraints, supported by rigorous mathematical guarantees.</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Systems & Controls) from the University of Texas at San Antonio in December 2024. Prior to that, I obtained Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in May 2019. </p>
