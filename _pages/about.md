<p>Pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Systems & Controls) at the University of Texas at San Antonio, I focus my research on motion planning for the cooperative and adversarial maneuvering of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). My work primarily involves developing advanced guidance laws that enable UAVs to achieve specific behaviors such as formation flying, enclosing, and swarming, whether in coordination with other UAVs or in response to uncooperative agents. A key feature of my research is the integration of flexibility, safety, and robustness into motion planning algorithms, ensuring that these systems can operate reliably with limited information or reduced communication between agents while maintaining strong mathematical guarantees. </p>
<p>Before embarking on my Ph.D., I served as a project engineer at the VTOL and Helicopter Laboratory, where I developed a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulation framework for helicopter UAVs. My academic background includes both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.  </p> 
<p>My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within the field of autonomous systems and robotics, particularly in the areas of autonomous guidance and control, motion planning for multi-agent systems, Deep Learning, vehicle design, system identification, and flight dynamics modeling.</p>
