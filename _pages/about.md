I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Unmanned Systems Laboratory, University of Texas at San Antonio, specializing in guidance and motion planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). My research focuses on designing advanced algorithms for cooperative and adversarial UAV maneuvering, emphasizing behaviors such as flexible formation flying, adaptive target enclosing, and coordinated swarming. I am particularly interested in integrating robustness, flexibility, and safety into guidance and control algorithms, ensuring reliable performance even under limited communication and information constraints. My broader research interests encompass a wide range of topics in guidance and control, motion planning, cooperative control, nonlinear and optimal control, deep reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning and flight dynamics modeling. 

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Systems & Controls) from the University of Texas at San Antonio in December 2024, and I hold Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
