The field of automatic guidance and control of unmanned systems is rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and communication systems. This area encompasses a wide range of applications, from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mobile manipulators, each requiring sophisticated control strategies to navigate complex environments effectively. This research aims to develop robust, adaptive guidance algorithms that ensure safety, efficiency, and flexibility in dynamic conditions. By leveraging methodologies such as Software in the Loop (SITL) and Hardware in the Loop (HITL) simulations, our work emphasizes the importance of rapid prototyping in optimizing control strategies. The integration of robust guidance mechanisms that account for factors such as autopilot lag and GPS-denied conditions ensures that unmanned systems can operate reliably and autonomously across diverse operational scenarios.

In this work, we focus on the rapid development and testing of guidance algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulations. SITL allows for the testing of guidance strategies in a simulated environment that replicates real-world conditions, enabling rapid prototyping without the risk and expense of live flight tests. HITL further validates the algorithms by integrating actual UAV hardware components into the simulation loop, providing more realistic feedback on performance under real-world constraints such as sensor delays, actuator limits, and environmental disturbances. Together, these approaches accelerate the development process, ensuring that UAV guidance algorithms are robust, reliable, and ready for deployment in field operations.
