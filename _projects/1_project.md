We present a novel formation strategy for a leader-follower unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, drawing inspiration from the behavior of human pilots. In our approach, the formation geometry is not restricted to remain fixed as the vehicles maneuver. This means that the position and orientation of the follower UAV in relation to the leader UAV can change while adhering to certain constraints. Our strategy aims to maintain a desired fixed relative distance between the follower and leader UAVs, allowing for variations in their orientation. This flexibility in orientation helps reduce control effort for the follower UAV and offers tactical advantages. We term this approach as a "flexible relational maneuvering scheme" since the follower UAV is not constrained to a predetermined set of feasible positions, as is typical in close-proximity two-ship formations in air-to-air combat. Our approach seeks to replicate the behavior of human pilots in UAVs by implementing anticipatory maneuvers when the leader UAV executes aggressive turns.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
