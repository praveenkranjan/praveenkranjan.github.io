In our approach, the formation geometry is not restricted to remain fixed as the vehicles maneuver. This means that the position and orientation of the follower UAV in relation to the leader UAV can change while adhering to certain constraints. Our strategy aims to maintain a desired fixed relative distance between the follower and leader UAVs, allowing for variations in their orientation. This flexibility in orientation helps reduce control effort for the follower UAV and offers tactical advantages. We term this approach as a “flexible relational maneuvering scheme” since the follower UAV is not constrained to a predetermined set of feasible positions, as is typical in close-proximity two-ship formations in air-to-air combat. Our approach seeks to replicate the behavior of human pilots in UAVs by implementing anticipatory maneuvers when the leader UAV executes aggressive turns.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_1.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_4.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> FBFM with different desired bearing angles. </div> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_2.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> FBFM Software in the Loop Simulation results. </div> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/flex_form/flex_form_web_3.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> FBFM Flight Experiments results. </div> </body></html>
